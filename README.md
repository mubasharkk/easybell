# EasyBell

## Introduction:

This test should take an average of 3h to be done, but you wonâ€™t be evaluated by the
amount of time spent but the by the following items:

* Code of quality and readability
* Knowledge of the framework(s)
* Approach taken to solve the test

### Requirements:

Use Laravel and Vue.js (whatever version you prefer) to create a system where the registered
users can favorite or unfavorite photos. The latest favorite photos picked by all registered
users are shown in a page accessible by guest users.

You can use the JsonPlaceholder image API to list all the possible images which the
registered users can pick from. Use a simple pagination to go through all the possible images
(Tip: the api excepts _start and _limit as query parameters).
More information for JsonPlaceholder APIs can be found here.

You can use any other frontend plugin/tool you feel useful to reach the desired outcome.
You may also create tests, use design patterns and anything you believe will enrich your
showcase.

Please commit the code to GitHub and send the repository link to us.
